the user profile is populated when the user first logs in using their email
when the user first completes the checkout process, the user profile is updated with the user's name, phone number, and address
the next time the user checks out, the user profile is used to populate the checkout form

when a tab is opened the checkout form should only be presented once when the customer is closing the tab not everytime an order is added to the tab
