While customer is opening a tab - Remove Tip from payment options for an order and add it in only during the checkout when customer is making final payment and closing the tab

When a new order has been placed as part of a tab, the orders page showing a list of all orders should show not only show previous orders but now since the customer has opened a tab with an order in it, it should show the tab as well with summary details from where the customer can select the tab to view detail of the orders that make up the tab. This is only relevant when we have tabs. Orders are only displayed if they are not part of a tab.

when customer has an existing open tab and is creating another order when, they select proceed to checkout, the customer info page should not be displayed. This information should be persisted from then the initial order as part of this tab was created and when navigated to the order details page this should also be persisted from the initial order as part of this tab. and once navigated to the payment options page the only option available should be for the customer to add this order to the existing tab.
