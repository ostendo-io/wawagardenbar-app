## Wawa Cafe Web App Development Project

### Project Overview

Build a comprehensive, full-stack food ordering platform for Wawa Cafe. The entire application (frontend, backend, and admin dashboard) will be built as a single, unified **Next.js 14+ (App Router)** project.

The application will be a **mobile-first, responsive web app** that facilitates table service, pickup, and delivery orders. It will be built following a strict set of modern architectural principles, including a Server-Component-first philosophy, a clear separation of concerns, and a type-safe codebase.
